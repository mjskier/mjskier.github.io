# This is header 1

Some header 1 stuff

## This is header 2

Some level 2 stuff

### This is header 3

About some inline `quoted thing`


Or some code block


```
Is this thing on.
Cool or not?
```

Tables work?


| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |



There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.


Markdown | Less | Pretty

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
